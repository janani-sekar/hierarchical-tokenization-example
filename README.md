# Hierarchical Tokenization Example

A demonstration of hierarchical tokenization techniques for processing mathematical equations.

## Overview

This project provides examples and utilities for hierarchical tokenization of mathematical expressions. Hierarchical tokenization breaks down complex mathematical equations into structured tokens that preserve the mathematical hierarchy and relationships between components.

## Features

- Tokenization of mathematical expressions
- Hierarchical structure preservation
- Support for nested operations
